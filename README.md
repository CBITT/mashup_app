# mashup_app

Designed and developed mobile mashup. The application demonstrates a gathering of various online web services using the published APIs (Facebook, Google Maps and Open Weather Map). The APIs include the following protocols: REST, JSON.

## Prerequisites

Open Weather Map uses authorisation key. For demonstration purposes I obtained a free key that provides basic weather data and limited amount of calls a day.
